calcHourlyLaborCosts(
  datasource = "USDA_FAO",
  dataVersionILO = "Aug24",
  sector = "agriculture",
  fillWithRegression = TRUE,
  calibYear = 2010,
  cutAfterCalibYear = TRUE,
  projection = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasource}{either raw data from "ILO" (agriculture+forestry+fishery) or data calculated based on total labor
costs from "USDA_FAO" (crop+livestock production).}

\item{dataVersionILO}{Which version of ILO data to use (for hourly labor costs if source is ILO, for ag empl. if
source is USDA_FAO). "" for the oldest version, or "monthYear" (e.g. "Aug24") for a newer version)}

\item{sector}{should average hourly labor costs be reported ("agriculture"), or hourly labor costs specific to
either "crops" or "livestock" production. For ILO only the aggregate hourly labor costs are available.}

\item{fillWithRegression}{boolean: should missing values be filled based on a regression between ILO hourly labor
costs and GDPpcMER (calibrated to countries)}

\item{calibYear}{in case of fillWithRegression being TRUE, data after this year will be ignored and calculated using
the regression (calibrated for each year to calibYear, or the most recent year with data before calibYear). NULL if
all data should be used for calibration}

\item{cutAfterCalibYear}{boolean, only relevant if fillWithRegression is TRUE. If cutAfterCalibYear is TRUE, raw
data after the calib year is overwritten by regression results (necessary for consistency with calculation within
MAgPIE). If FALSE, raw data is kept and only gaps are filled with regression}

\item{projection}{either FALSE or SSP on which projections should be based. Only relevant if fillWithRegression is
TRUE.}
